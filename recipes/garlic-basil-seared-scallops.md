### Ingredients

- 1 pound sea scallops  
- Salt and fresh ground black pepper  
- 1 tablespoon olive oil  
- 1 tablespoon butter  
- 2 garlic cloves, minced  
- 1 cup fresh basil leaves  
- Juice from half a lemon  
- Lemon slices, for serving (optional)

### Instructions

1. Remove the small side muscle from the scallops if attached. Pat scallops dry with paper towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper.  
2. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until very hot and shimmering.  
3. Add scallops in a single layer and sear without moving them until well browned on one side, about 1½ minutes.  
4. Flip scallops and add butter and garlic to the pan.  
5. Cook while spooning the melted butter and garlic over scallops until they are just firm and opaque, about 1½ minutes more.  
6. Remove pan from heat, stir in basil and lemon juice, and serve immediately with lemon slices if desired.

### Notes

- For a golden crust, ensure scallops are very dry before searing.  
- Optional dusting of flour can help with browning (see original recipe).
