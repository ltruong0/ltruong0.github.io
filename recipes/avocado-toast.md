### Ingredients (makes 1 slice)

- 1 slice good-quality, thick-sliced whole‑grain bread  
- ½ ripe avocado  
- Pinch of salt  
- **Optional toppings**: flaky sea salt, black pepper, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, cherry tomatoes, eggs, fresh herbs

### Instructions

1. Toast the bread until golden and firm.  
2. Pit and scoop avocado into a bowl; mash with a fork until creamy. Mix in a pinch of salt.  
3. Spread mashed avocado evenly over the toast.  
4. Enjoy as-is, or add toppings like flaky salt, pepper, lemon juice, red pepper flakes, cherry tomatoes, eggs, or herbs.

### Notes

- Best served immediately to avoid browning.  
- Fully customizable—try garlic, pesto, balsamic, or a fried egg for more flavor.
